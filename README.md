FIRST-PROBLEM (package Two) :
  Given an array of size n such that each element contains either a 'P' for policeman or a 'T'
  for thief. Find the maximum number of thieves that can be caught by the police.
  Keep in mind the following conditions :
    1. Each policeman can catch only one thief.
    2. A policeman cannot catch a thief who is more than K units away from him.
    
SECOND-PROBLEM (package thiteen) :
  Given an unsorted integer array, find a pair with the given sum in it. We can use hashing to solve this
  problem in linear time.
    
THIRD-PROBLEM (package fourteen) :
  Given an integer array, find the minimum index of a repeating element in linear time and doing just a
  single traversal of the array. We can use hashing to solve this problem in linear time.
 
FOURTH-PROBLEM (package fifteen) :
  Given an unsorted integer array containing many duplicate elements, rearrange it such that the same
  element appears together and the relative order of the first occurrence of each element remains
  unchanged.
